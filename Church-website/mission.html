      <p class="youth-text">
        <!-- When we (the youth group) first heard about the church being in the
        process of getting a new one, we came up with the idea of making a
        website and a few other accounts in social media including Youtube,
        Instagram, and TikTok. It became a youth project and all of us started
        working immediately. With the team effort, the youth successfully
        completed the website and all the accounts, including a GoFundMe to help
        the church out with money.  -->

        When the church announced that they had began to raise money for the
        church, the youth group came up with the idea to create a GoFundMe and a
        website to promote it so that people from anywhere in the country could
        pitch and help the church raise money. We created different social media
        accounts such as Facebook and YouTube so that people could learn more
        about us and our goal toward having our own church. We hope that you
        would be willing to donate any amount on the GoFundMe. Even small
        donations can make a big difference. Any donation is welcome.
